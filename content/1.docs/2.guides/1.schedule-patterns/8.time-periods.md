# Time Periods

Define the **time slots** within a day. Use one or more `addPeriod()` calls after setting recurrence and date range.

```php
$schedule = Zap::for($doctor)
    ->named('Office Hours')
    ->availability();

// Single period
$schedule->addPeriod('09:00', '17:00');

// Multiple periods (split shifts)
$schedule->addPeriod('09:00', '12:00');
$schedule->addPeriod('14:00', '17:00');
```

Times are in 24-hour format. Combine with any recurrence (e.g. [Daily & Weekly](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/daily-weekly), [Monthly](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/monthly-quarterly)) and [Date Ranges](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/date-ranges), then `save()`.
