# Monthly Ordinal Weekday

Recurring schedules can be defined by **which weekday of the month** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or last), not only by day-of-month numbers. This is useful for meetings like “every first Wednesday” or “every last Monday.”

## API

Use fluent methods on the schedule builder. Ordinals: `firstXOfMonth()`, `secondXOfMonth()`, `thirdXOfMonth()`, `fourthXOfMonth()`, `lastXOfMonth()`. Replace **X** with any weekday: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.

That gives **35 method names** (5 ordinals × 7 days). Examples: `firstWednesdayOfMonth()`, `secondFridayOfMonth()`, `lastMondayOfMonth()`.

## Examples

```php
// Every 1st Wednesday of the month
Zap::for($resource)->firstWednesdayOfMonth()->forYear(2025)->addPeriod('09:00', '10:00')->save();

// Every 2nd Friday of the month
Zap::for($resource)->secondFridayOfMonth()->forYear(2025)->addPeriod('14:00', '15:00')->save();

// Every last Monday of the month
Zap::for($resource)->lastMondayOfMonth()->forYear(2025)->addPeriod('16:00', '17:00')->save();
```

With a full chain (e.g. availability or appointment):

```php
// Monthly standup — 1st Wednesday
Zap::for($room)
    ->named('Monthly Standup')
    ->appointment()
    ->firstWednesdayOfMonth()
    ->forYear(2025)
    ->addPeriod('09:00', '10:00')
    ->save();

// Month-end retro — last Monday
Zap::for($room)
    ->named('Month-End Retro')
    ->appointment()
    ->lastMondayOfMonth()
    ->forYear(2025)
    ->addPeriod('16:00', '17:00')
    ->save();

// Bi-weekly-style meeting — 2nd Friday
Zap::for($resource)
    ->named('Bi-Monthly Review')
    ->appointment()
    ->secondFridayOfMonth()
    ->forYear(2025)
    ->addPeriod('14:00', '15:00')
    ->save();
```

## Use cases

| Use case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Monthly standup | 1st Wednesday of the month |
| Month-end review / retro | Last Monday or last Friday |
| Recurring review (bi-monthly style) | 2nd Friday of the month |
| Board meeting | 3rd Tuesday of the month |
| Weekly-style but once per month | 4th Thursday of the month |

## Technical detail (reference)

- Stored as frequency `monthly_ordinal_weekday` with config: `ordinal` (1–5, 5 = last) and `day_of_week` (0–6).
- Works with conflict detection, bookable slots, and schedule queries like other recurring patterns.

For monthly by **day-of-month** (e.g. 1st and 15th), see [Monthly, Bimonthly & Quarterly](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/monthly-quarterly). For every N months, see [Dynamic monthly](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/dynamic-monthly).
