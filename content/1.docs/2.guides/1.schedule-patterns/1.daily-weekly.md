# Daily & Weekly

## Daily

Schedule runs every day within your date range.

```php
$schedule = Zap::for($doctor)
    ->named('Office Hours')
    ->availability();

$schedule->daily()
    ->from('2025-01-01')
    ->to('2025-12-31');
```

## Weekly (specific days)

Use `weekly()` with an array of weekday names. Add `addPeriod()` for time slots and `from()/to()` or `forYear()` for the validity range.

```php
$schedule->weekly(['monday', 'wednesday', 'friday'])->forYear(2025);
```

## weekDays() — weekly + single time period

`weekDays()` combines weekly recurrence with one time period in a single call. Useful for office hours or regular shifts.

```php
// Using weekDays() - combines weekly() and addPeriod()
Zap::for($doctor)
    ->named('Office Hours')
    ->availability()
    ->weekDays(['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday'], '09:00', '17:00')
    ->forYear(2025)
    ->save();

// Equivalent to:
Zap::for($doctor)
    ->named('Office Hours')
    ->availability()
    ->weekly(['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday'])
    ->addPeriod('09:00', '17:00')
    ->forYear(2025)
    ->save();
```

:::tip
Use `weekDays()` when you have a single time period for specific weekdays. For multiple time periods (e.g., split shifts), use `weekly()` with multiple `addPeriod()` calls instead.
