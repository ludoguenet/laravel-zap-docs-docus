# Biweekly

Schedule runs **every 2 weeks** on the given weekdays. The week of the schedule’s start date (or the optional anchor) is the first occurrence.

```php
$schedule = Zap::for($doctor)
    ->named('Office Hours')
    ->availability();

// Bi-weekly (week of the start date by default, optional anchor)
$schedule->biweekly(['tuesday', 'thursday'])
    ->from('2025-01-07')
    ->to('2025-03-31');
```

Use `from()/to()` or `forYear()` and `addPeriod()` as needed, then `save()`.

For intervals of **3 to 52 weeks**, use the dynamic weekly methods: [Every X weeks](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/dynamic-weekly) (`everyThreeWeeks`, `everyFourWeeks`, … `everyFiftyTwoWeeks`).
