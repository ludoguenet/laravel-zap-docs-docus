# Schedule Patterns

Zap supports flexible recurrence patterns: daily, weekly (including odd/even weeks), biweekly, **dynamic weekly** (every 3–52 weeks), monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, **monthly ordinal weekday** (e.g. 1st Wednesday or last Monday of the month), and **dynamic monthly** (every 4, 5, 7–11 months). You also define **date ranges** and **time periods** for each schedule.
