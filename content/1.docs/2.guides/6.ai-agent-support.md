# AI Agent Support

## 🤖 Laravel Boost 2.0 Skills

Laravel Zap ships with native [Laravel Boost](https://laravelboost.com) 2.0 support. When both packages are installed, Boost automatically discovers Zap's skills, enabling AI agents to generate accurate scheduling code with full knowledge of the API.

**Zero configuration required** — just install both packages and your AI agent automatically gains context about Laravel Zap's scheduling API.

## 📦 Included Skills

Zap provides three skills located in `resources/boost/skills/`:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **zap-schedules** | Schedule types (availability, appointment, blocked, custom), fluent builder API, validation rules, conflict detection |
| **zap-availability** | Bookable slots, availability checks, querying schedules |
| **zap-recurrence** | Daily, weekly, odd/even weeks, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually |

## 🚀 How It Works

Laravel Boost 2.0 introduced "Skills" — a way for packages to ship AI-contextual documentation that agents auto-discover. When users have both Laravel Boost and Laravel Zap installed:

1. Boost scans installed packages for skill definitions
2. Zap's skills are automatically loaded
3. AI agents receive accurate, package-specific context
4. Code generation becomes more reliable and API-aware

```php
// Your AI agent now understands Zap's full API
// and can generate correct scheduling code like:

Zap::for($doctor)
    ->named('Office Hours')
    ->availability()
    ->weekDays(['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday'], '09:00', '17:00')
    ->forYear(2025)
    ->save();
```

## ✅ Requirements

- Laravel Zap (any version)
- Laravel Boost 2.0 or higher

:::tip
Skills are read-only documentation that help AI agents understand your codebase. They don't execute code or modify your application — they simply provide context for better code generation.
