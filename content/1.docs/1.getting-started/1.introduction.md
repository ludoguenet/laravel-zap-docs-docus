# Introduction

## 🎯 What is Zap?

A comprehensive calendar and scheduling system for Laravel. Manage availabilities, appointments, blocked times, and custom schedules for any resource—doctors, meeting rooms, employees, and more.

**Perfect for:** appointment booking systems • resource scheduling • shift management • calendar applications

## 🧩 Core Concepts

Zap is built around four fundamental schedule types:

| Type | Purpose | Overlap Behavior |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Availability** | Define when resources can be booked | ✅ Allows overlaps |
| **Appointment** | Actual bookings or scheduled events | ❌ Prevents overlaps |
| **Blocked** | Periods where booking is forbidden | ❌ Prevents overlaps |
| **Custom** | Neutral schedules with explicit rules | ⚙️ You define the rules |
