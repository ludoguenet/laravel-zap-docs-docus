# Introduction

## 🎯 What is Zap?

A comprehensive calendar and scheduling system for Laravel. Manage **availabilities**, **appointments**, **blocked** times, and **custom** schedules for any resource—doctors, meeting rooms, employees, and more.

**Perfect for:** appointment booking systems • resource scheduling • shift management • calendar applications

## 🧩 Core concepts

Zap is built around four **schedule types**. Each schedule has one or more **periods** (time slots). **Recurrence** (daily, weekly, monthly, ordinal weekday, etc.) defines when the schedule repeats. **Bookable slots** are computed from availability minus appointments and blocked times.

| Type | Purpose | Overlap Behavior |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Availability** | When a resource can be booked | ✅ Allows overlaps |
| **Appointment** | Bookings / scheduled events | ❌ Prevents overlaps |
| **Blocked** | When booking is forbidden | ❌ Prevents overlaps |
| **Custom** | Your rules (overlap, etc.) | ⚙️ You define the rules |

## How it fits together

- **Availability** defines when a resource *can* be booked.
- **Appointments** and **blocked** periods mark when it *cannot* be booked (they prevent overlaps).
- To get **bookable slots** for a date, Zap uses availability and subtracts appointments and blocked times (see [Query & Check](/docs/guides/query-check)).
- Schedules can be **one-off** (single date) or **recurring** (daily, weekly, monthly, [first/last weekday of month](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns/ordinal-weekday), etc.). All recurrence is covered in [Schedule patterns](/docs/guides/schedule-patterns).
