# Installation

**Requirements:**
- PHP 8.2 to 8.5
- Laravel 11.0 to 12

## Before Running Migrations (UUID/ULID/GUID)

If your models use UUID-style primary keys, review the custom model steps in the [Configuration guide](/docs/guides/configuration#custom-model-support-uuids-ulids-guids) before publishing or running the migrations.

## Composer

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require laraveljutsu/zap
```

## Setup

Publish the migrations and run them:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zap-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

Add the `HasSchedules` trait to your schedulable models:

```php
use Zap\Models\Concerns\HasSchedules;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Doctor extends Model
{
    use HasSchedules;
}
```
